======================
Set Up the SDK for iOS
======================

To get started with the AWS SDK for iOS, you can set up the SDK and start building a new
project, or you integrate the SDK in an existing project. You can also run the samples to
get a sense of how the SDK works.

To use the AWS SDK for iOS, you will need the following installed on your development
machine:

- Xcode 7 or later

- iOS 7 or later

At the AWS GitHub repo, you can check out the `SDK source code <https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ios>`_.

.. _include_sdk_ios:

Include the SDK for iOS in an Existing Application
##################################################

The samples included with the SDK for iOS are standalone projects that are already set up
for you. You can also integrate the SDK for iOS with your own existing project. There are
two ways to import the AWS Mobile SDK for iOS into your project:

- CocoaPods
- Frameworks

You should use one of these two ways to import the AWS Mobile SDK but not both. Importing
both ways loads two copies of the SDK into the project and causes compiler errors.

CocoaPods
=========

#. The AWS Mobile SDK for iOS is available through `CocoaPods <http://cocoapods.org/>`_. If you have not
   installed CocoaPods, install it by running the command:

   :command:`$ sudo gem install cocoapods`

#. In your project directory (the directory where your :file:`*.xcodeproj` file is), create a plain text file
   named :file:`Podfile` (without any file extension) and add the lines below. If you want to use Amazon
   Cognito Sync, make sure to include pod "AWSCognitoSync" as well::

       source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
       pod 'AWSCore'
       pod 'AWSAutoScaling'
       pod 'AWSCloudWatch'
       pod 'AWSDynamoDB'
       pod 'AWSEC2'
       pod 'AWSElasticLoadBalancing'
       pod 'AWSKinesis'
       pod 'AWSLambda'
       pod 'AWSMachineLearning'
       pod 'AWSMobileAnalytics'
       pod 'AWSS3'
       pod 'AWSSES'
       pod 'AWSSimpleDB'
       pod 'AWSSNS'
       pod 'AWSSQS'
       pod 'AWSCognito'


#. Then run the following command::

    $ pod install

#. Open up :file:`*.xcworkspace` with Xcode and start using the SDK.

.. note:: Do NOT use :file:`*.xcodeproj`. If you open up a project file instead of a workspace, you receive an error.

Frameworks
==========

#. Download the SDK from http://aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdk. The SDK is stored in a compressed
   file archive named :file:`aws-ios-sdk-#.#.#` (where '#.#.#' represents the version number, so for version
   2.2.2, the filename is
   :file:`aws-ios-sdk-2.2.2`).

   .. note:: The size of AWSiOSSDKv2.framework is > 65MB; however, it does not add > 65MB to your app binary when imported to your project. To learn more about the size of the app binary, see the `note under "Frameworks" <https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ios/#frameworks>`_.

#. With your project open in Xcode, Control+click :strong:`Frameworks` and then click :strong:`Add files to
   "<project name>"...`.

#. In Finder, navigate to the :file:`AWSxxx.framework` (where 'xxx' is the AWS service you wish to use) file, select the following files, and click :strong:`Add`.

- :file:`AWSCore.framework`
- :file:`AWSAutoScaling.framework`
- :file:`AWSCloudWatch.framework`
- :file:`AWSDynamoDB.framework`
- :file:`AWSEC2.framework`
- :file:`AWSElasticLoadBalancing.framework`
- :file:`AWSKinesis.framework`
- :file:`AWSLambda.framework`
- :file:`AWSMachineLearning.framework`
- :file:`AWSMobileAnalytics.framework`
- :file:`AWSS3.framework`
- :file:`AWSSES.framework`
- :file:`AWSSimpleDB.framework`
- :file:`AWSSNS.framework`
- :file:`AWSSQS.framework`
- :file:`extras/AWSCognito.framework` (for Cognito Sync)

4. Open a target for your project, select :strong:`Build Phases`, expand :strong:`Link Binary With Libraries`, click the :strong:`+` button, and add :file:`libsqlite3.dylib` and :file:`libz.dylib` and :file:`SystemConfiguration.framework`.

Update the SDK to a Newer Version
#################################

When a new version of the SDK is released, you can pick up the changes as described below.

CocoaPods
=========

Run the following command in your project directory. CocoaPods automatically picks up the new changes.

:command:`$ pod update`

.. note:: If your pod is having an issue, you can delete :file:`Podfile.lock` and :file:`Pods/` and then run :command:`pod install` to cleanly install the SDK.

Frameworks
==========

Follow the installation process shown previously to include the new version of the SDK.

Preparing iOS 9 Apps
####################

The release of iOS 9 includes changes that might impact how your apps interact with some AWS services. If you compile your apps with Appleâ€™s iOS 9 SDK
(or Xcode 7), there are additional steps you must complete for your app to successfully connect with any AWS service you need to call. For more information,
see `Preparing Your Apps for iOS 9 <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/ats.html>`_.

Getting Started with Swift
##########################

#. Create an Objective-C bridging header file using Xcode.

#. In the bridging header, import the appropriate headers for the services you are using. The header file
   import convention for CocoaPods is ``#import "SERVICENAME.h"``, and for frameworks it is ``#import
   <FRAMEWORKNAME/SERVICENAME.h>``, as in the following examples::

   #import <AWSCore/AWSCore.h>
   #import <AWSS3/AWSS3.h>
   #import <AWSDynamoDB/AWSDynamoDB.h>
   #import <AWSSQS/AWSSQS.h>
   #import <AWSSNS/AWSSNS.h>
   #import <AWSCognito/AWSCognito.h>


#. From :guilabel:`Your Target` > :guilabel:`Build Settings` > :guilabel:`Objective-C Bridging Header`, point
   :guilabel:`Objective-C Bridging Header` to the bridging header you just created.

#. Import the AWSCore header in the application delegate::

       #import <AWSCore/AWSCore.h>

#. Create a default service configuration by adding the following code snippet in the ``application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`` application delegate method::

	let credentialsProvider = AWSCognitoCredentialsProvider(
		regionType: AWSRegionType.USEast1, identityPoolId: cognitoIdentityPoolId)

	let defaultServiceConfiguration = AWSServiceConfiguration(
		region: AWSRegionType.USEast1, credentialsProvider: credentialsProvider)

	AWSServiceManager.defaultServiceManager().defaultServiceConfiguration = defaultServiceConfiguration


#. Make a call to the AWS services::

       let dynamoDB = AWSDynamoDB.defaultDynamoDB()
       let listTableInput = AWSDynamoDBListTablesInput()
       dynamoDB.listTables(listTableInput).continueWithBlock{ (task: AWSTask!) -> AnyObject! in
           if let error = task.error {
               print("Error occurred: \(error)")
               return nil
	    }

           let listTablesOutput = task.result as AWSDynamoDBListTablesOutput

           for tableName : AnyObject in listTablesOutput.tableNames {
               print("\(tableName)")
           }

           return nil
       }

   .. note:: Most of the service client classes have a singleton method to get a default client. The naming convention is ``+ defaultSERVICENAME`` (e.g. ``+ defaultDynamoDB`` in the above code snippet). This singleton method creates a service client with ``defaultServiceConfiguration``, which you set up in step 5, and maintains a strong reference to the client.

Getting Started with Objective-C
################################

#. Import the AWSCore header in the application delegate::

       #import <AWSCore/AWSCore.h>

#. Create a default service configuration by adding the following code snippet in the ``application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`` application delegate method.::

	AWSCognitoCredentialsProvider *credentialsProvider = [[AWSCognitoCredentialsProvider alloc] initWithRegionType:AWSRegionUSEast1
		identityPoolId:CognitoPoolID];

	AWSServiceConfiguration *configuration = [[AWSServiceConfiguration alloc] initWithRegion:AWSRegionUSEast1
		credentialsProvider:credentialsProvider];

	AWSServiceManager.defaultServiceManager.defaultServiceConfiguration = configuration;

#. Import service headers where you want to use the services. The header file import convention for frameworks is ``#import <FRAMEWORKNAME/SERVICENAME.h>``, as in the following examples::

   #import <AWSCore/AWSCore.h>
   #import <AWSS3/AWSS3.h>
   #import <AWSDynamoDB/AWSDynamoDB.h>
   #import <AWSSQS/AWSSQS.h>
   #import <AWSSNS/AWSSNS.h>
   #import <AWSCognito/AWSCognito.h>


#. Make a call to the AWS services::

       AWSS3Transfermanager *transferManager = [AWSS3Transfermanager defaultS3TransferManager];
       AWSS3TransferManagerUploadRequest *uploadRequest = [AWSS3TransferManagerUploadRequest new];
       uploadRequest.bucket = yourBucket;
       uploadRequest.key = yourKey;
       uploadRequest.body = yourDataURL;
       uploadRequest.contentLength = [NSNumber numberWithUnsignedLongLong:fileSize];

       [[transferManager upload:uploadRequest] continueWithBlock:^id(AWSTask *task) {
           // Do something with the response
           return nil;
       }];

   .. note:: Most of the service client classes have a singleton method to get a default client. The naming convention is ``+ defaultSERVICENAME`` (e.g. ``+ defaultS3TransferManager`` in the above code snippet). This singleton method creates a service client with ``defaultServiceConfiguration``, which you set up in step 5, and maintains a strong reference to the client.

Logging
#######

Changing log levels during development may make debugging easier. You can change the log level by importing AWSCore.h and calling:

**Swift**::

    AWSLogger.defaultLogger().logLevel = .Verbose

The following logging level options are available:

- ``.None``
- ``.Error`` (This is the default. Only error logs are printed to the console.)
- ``.Warn``
- ``.Info``
- ``.Debug``
- ``.Verbose``

**Objective-C**::

    [AWSLogger defaultLogger].logLevel = AWSLogLevelVerbose;

The following logging level options are available:

- ``AWSLogLevelNone``
- ``AWSLogLevelError`` (This is the default. Only error logs are printed to the console.)
- ``AWSLogLevelWarn``
- ``AWSLogLevelInfo``
- ``AWSLogLevelDebug``
- ``AWSLogLevelVerbose``


Get AWS Credentials with Amazon Cognito or AWS Identity and Access Management
=============================================================================

We recommend using Amazon Cognito as your credential provider to access AWS services from your
mobile app. Cognito provides a secure mechanism to access AWS services without having to embed
credentials in your app. To learn more, see :doc:`cognito-auth`.

Alternatively, you can use `AWS Identity and Access
Management <http://aws.amazon.com/iam/>`_ (IAM). If you choose IAM, ensure that your role's policy is minimally scoped
so that it can only perform the desired actions for the service being used.

Sample Apps

Install the Reference Documentation in Xcode
############################################

The AWS SDK for iOS includes documentation in the DocSets format that you can view within
Xcode. The easiest way to install the documentation is to use the Mac OS X
terminal.

To install the DocSet for Xcode
===============================

Open the Mac OS X terminal and go to the directory containing the expanded
archive. For example:

::

    $ cd ~/Downloads/aws-ios-sdk-2.2.2

.. note:: Remember to replace :command:`2.2.2` in the example above with the
   actual version number of the AWS SDK for iOS that you downloaded.

Create a directory called
:file:`~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets`:

::

    $ mkdir -p ~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets

Copy (or move) :file:`documentation/com.amazon.aws.ios.docset`
from the SDK installation files to the directory you created in the previous
step:

::

    $ mv documentation/com.amazon.aws.ios.docset ~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets/

If Xcode was running during this procedure, restart Xcode. To browse the
documentation, go to :strong:`Help`, click :strong:`Documentation and API Reference`, and select :strong:`AWS SDK for iOS v2.0 Documentation`
(where '2.0' is the appropriate version number).
